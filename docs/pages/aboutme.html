                <p class="p">I'm a student and front-end dev,
interested in graphic design, web development and developing videogames.</p>
                <p class="p2">My dream job is to be a Machinist, which is to make blueprints for the parts that you want to work on in CAD/CAM programs (mostly from metal) and then program the machine what to do and where the material should be cut, and then let the machine do its work.
But on the other side there are manual machines, where you must manually move the machine to the place you want to drill, turn or mill the material. Click <a href="https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/finding-a-job/what-is-a-machinist" class="jobinfo">here</a> for more info about the job.</p>
